Introduction
This project provides an implementation of a Binary Tree in C++. A Binary Tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. Binary Trees are widely used for representing hierarchical relationships and for recursive algorithms.

Features
Key Characteristics
A general tree structure with no ordering rules.
Each node can have up to two children: left and right.
Suitable for hierarchical data and generic tree algorithms.
Supported Operations
Tree Traversals:
Preorder: Visit the root, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.
Inorder: Visit the left subtree, then the root, and finally the right subtree.
Postorder: Visit the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the root.
Level Order: Traverse level by level (breadth-first).
Insertion:
Insert nodes level by level, filling left-to-right.
Other Operations:
Compute the height of the tree.
Count total nodes and leaf nodes.
